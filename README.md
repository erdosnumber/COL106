# COL106 (Data Structures and Algorithms)

These are the assignments that I had done in the course COL106 in my Semester 3 at IIT Delhi.

## Assignment 1
We needed to evaluate an arithmetic expression (a string) consisting of the symbols 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,(,),+,\*,/ and -
The data structure of stack was implemented for this purpose.

## Assignment 2
We needed to simulate the elastic collisions of n particles in 1-dimension with given initial velocities and positions.
The data structure of heap was implemented for this purpose.

## Assignment 3
We needed to implement the search nearby feature of a map wherein we need some desirable points from a certain point P whose both x and y co-ordinates are within a range of d from P.
The data structure of segment tree was implemented for this purpose.

## Assignment 4
A tutorial assignment of rolling hash.

## Assignment 5
We were given a network with weighted edges representing pipelines with their capacities. We were needed to calculate the maximum flow that can take place between two nodes such that the
flow does not exceed the capacity of any pipeline through which it travels.
